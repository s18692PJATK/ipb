Getting a loan
Getting a loan starts with the client submitting an initial loan request.Request
is sent to one of bank tellers.  Bank teller asks the client about his
information(monthly income etc). After the clients sends the information, a risk
analyst analyzes the client's profile. If he decides he is not legible for a
loan, a notification about rejection is sent. If the decision is positive, a
request asking about the paying off period is sent to the client. Based on the
paying off period, an economist calculates interest rate and sends an offer of a
loan to customer. We wait for the response for 7 days, if we don't get a
response, or response is negative we end the process.If the client accepts the
offer, a clerk prepares additional documents, which are later sent to a manager
to confirm it. If the thinks that the document needs some improvements, he
enters the improvements.After that we send the final of the loan document to the
client.When we get back the signed document from the client the process ends.
